Building a web-based cosmetology tutoring system with Django, jQuery AJAX, and Bootstrap is a comprehensive project. In this project, you'll be creating a web application that allows students to access cosmetology tutorials, watch videos, take quizzes, and interact with instructors. Here's an overview of the steps involved:

**1. Setting up your development environment:**

- Install Python and Django.
- Create a virtual environment for your project.
- Set up a version control system like Git.

- Create relationships between these models as needed.

**4. Building the User Authentication System:**

- Use Django's built-in authentication system to handle user registration, login, and password reset.
- Customize the user model to include additional profile information if necessary.

**5. Implementing User Roles:**

- Create user roles such as students and instructors.
- Restrict access to certain parts of the application based on user roles.

**6. Creating the Frontend with Bootstrap:**

- Define permissions for different user roles.

**13. Testing:**

- Write unit tests and integration tests to ensure the functionality of your application.

**14. Deployment:**

- Deploy your application to a web server, using services like Heroku, AWS, or any other suitable hosting platform.
- Configure your production environment, including the database, static files, and domain settings.

**15. Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD):**

- Set up a CI/CD pipeline to automate testing and deployment processes.

**16. Maintenance and Updates:**
