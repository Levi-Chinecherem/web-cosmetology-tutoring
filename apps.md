Each app will represent a specific component or feature of this system. reate apps using the following command within your project directory:

```bash
python manage.py startapp app_name
```

Replace `app_name` with the name of the app you want to create. You should create separate apps for various components of your system, such as "users," "tutorials," "videos," "quizzes," "instructors," and "progress." Here's an example of how to create these apps:

1. Users App:

```bash
python manage.py startapp account
```

2. Tutorials App:

```bash
python manage.py startapp tutorials
```

3. Videos App:

```bash
python manage.py startapp videos
```

4. Quizzes App:

```bash
python manage.py startapp quizzes
```

5. Instructors App:

```bash
python manage.py startapp instructors
```

6. Progress App:

```bash
python manage.py startapp progress
```

Once you've created these apps, you can start building the functionality for each one. Let me know which app you'd like to work on first, and I'll provide guidance on setting up models, views, templates, and other components for that specific app.
